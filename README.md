# Project Submission: Web Development Task

## Overview

This project is a demonstration of web development skills learned throughout the course. It includes the use of HTML, CSS, Flexbox for layout, and JavaScript for interactive features. The goal was to create a website that adheres to specific criteria and showcases the application of semantic HTML, responsive design, and DOM manipulation.

## Project Criteria

- **HTML Structure**: Implemented `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, and `<aside>` elements, ensuring they are used correctly and only once per page. The structure is organized with `<header>` before `<main>` and `<footer>` after `<main>`.
- **Semantic HTML**: Ensured that each HTML element is used according to its purpose.
- **Flexbox Layout**: Used Flexbox for layout instead of floating elements.
- **Images**: Displayed relevant images in the `<aside>` element, either of personal photos or related to the content.
- **Responsiveness**: The website layout adjusts for different screen sizes using media queries.
- **JavaScript**: Incorporated JavaScript for interactive elements with dynamic content manipulation.

## Features

- **Semantic HTML**: Proper use of HTML5 semantic elements.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapted layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile views.
- **JavaScript Enhancements**: Implemented interactive features such as dynamic content manipulation.
