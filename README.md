# Bookshelf App Submission Project

This is my submission project for the **Belajar Membuat Front-End Web untuk Pemula** form **DICODING** class. The project is a bookshelf management app that allows users to record, manage, and track books they are reading. I have successfully completed the project and received a 5-star rating for meeting all the criteria.

## Features

### 1. Add New Book
Users can add new books using a form. The form collects:
- **Title**: The book's title.
- **Author**: The author of the book.
- **Year**: The year the book was released.
- **Reading Status**: Whether the book has been completed or not.

Each book is assigned a unique ID, which is automatically generated using a timestamp.

### 2. Two Book Shelves
The app displays books in two shelves:
- **Books not yet finished**: Books that are still being read.
- **Finished Books**: Books that have been completed.

Books can be moved between these shelves by updating their status.

### 3. Move Books Between Shelves
Users can change the reading status of books. If a book is moved from one shelf to another, its status is updated and saved in localStorage.

### 4. Delete Book
Books can be removed from either shelf, and the deletion is reflected in localStorage.

### 5. Search for Books (Optional Feature)
The app includes a search feature that allows users to search for books by title. This makes it easy to find books within the shelves.

### 6. Edit Book (Optional Feature)
Users can edit book details such as title, author, and year, directly from the app.

### 7. LocalStorage Persistence
All book data is stored in the browser's localStorage, so the data is retained even if the page is refreshed or closed.

### 8. Clean and Organized Code
- The code is written in a clear and consistent manner.
- Unused comments and code were removed.
- Variable and function names are meaningful and reflect their roles.

### 9. Custom Styling (Optional)
I have applied custom CSS to style the app and make it visually appealing.

## How to Use the App

1. **Add a New Book**: Fill out the form with the title, author, year, and reading status of the book.
2. **Manage Books**: Books will appear in the respective shelves. You can move books between shelves, edit details, or delete them.
3. **Search**: Use the search bar to filter books by title.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**
- **CSS**: Custom styles applied for a better user experience.
- **JavaScript**: Used for DOM manipulation, event handling, and localStorage operations.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates my ability to build a front-end web application using JavaScript to manage data and handle user interactions with the DOM. I met all the required and optional criteria, which earned me a 5-star rating!
